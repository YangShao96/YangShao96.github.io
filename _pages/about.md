My name is Yang Hu (胡阳 in Chinese), a Ph.D. student in Department of Physics & Astronomy at University of Pittsburgh, advised by <a href='https://www.purdylab.pitt.edu/team/'>Dr. Thomas P. Purdy </a>.

I'm interested in condensed matter physics experiments especially electro-optic transduction and quantum computation. One of my current projects aim to realize quantum level electro-optical transduction with nonlinear optical resonator consisting of nonlinear material LiNbO3. My other project aim to implement high-Q quartz mechanical resonator as quantum memory unit for quantum computation.

Before joining UPitt, I received my bachelor's degree in Physics from University of Science and Technology of China in 2016. During my undergraduate, I worked on metal-based catalysts for conversion of CO2, advised by <a href='  https://dcp.ustc.edu.cn/4456/list.htm'>Prof. Jie Zeng </a>.
