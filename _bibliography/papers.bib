  abstract = {Heterostructures composed of different layered materials provide novel opportunities to investigate the electronic correlations between them. Here we investigate frictional drag between graphene and LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) heterostructures. The LAO/STO layer underneath the graphene is rendered conductive using conductive atomic force microscope (c-AFM) lithography, creating a two-layer system in which the LAO serves as an ultrathin (< 2 nm) insulating barrier. By sourcing current in both the STO layer and graphene layer, Coulomb drag is studied in a wide range, from an STO superconducting region to a graphene quantum Hall region. Pronounced fluctuations in the frictional drag resistance are observed when the STO is superconducting. A large enhancement of drag resistance is observed when the STO becomes superconducting. Pronounced stripelike oscillations in the frictional drag appear in the quantum Hall region, both along the main channel and the transverse (Hall) configuration. The behavior is consistent with numerical simulations that model energy and momentum transfer from the STO layer to the graphene layer. These help to create a platform for graphene-based metamaterials using the programmable LAO/STO interface.}

Compared to previous reports that utilize conductive atomic force microscope (c-AFM) lithography, this approach can provide comparable resolution (∼10 nm) at write speeds (10 mm/s) that are up to 10 000× faster than c-AFM. The writing technique is nondestructive, and the conductive state is reversible via prolonged exposure to air. Transport properties of representative devices are measured at milli-Kelvin temperatures, where superconducting behavior is observed. We also demonstrate the ability to create conducting devices on graphene/LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures. The underlying mechanism is believed to be closely related to the same mechanism regulating c-AFM-based methods.}",

    abstract = "{The properties of graphene depend sensitively on doping with respect to the charge-neutrality point (CNP). Tuning the CNP usually requires electrical gating or chemical doping. Here, we describe a technique to reversibly control the CNP in graphene with nanoscale precision, utilizing LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) heterostructures and conductive atomic force microscope (c-AFM) lithography. The local electron density and resulting conductivity of the LAO/STO interface can be patterned with a conductive AFM tip [Cen et al., Nat. Mater. 7, 298 (2008)] and placed within two nanometers of an active graphene device [Huang et al., APL Mater. 3, 062502 (2015)]. The proximal LAO/STO nanostructures shift the position of graphene CNP by ∼1012 cm−2 and are also gateable. Here, we use this effect to create reconfigurable edge states in graphene, which are probed using the quantum Hall effect. Quantized resistance plateaus at h/e2 and h/3e2 are observed in a split Hall device, demonstrating edge transport along the c-AFM written edge that depends on the polarity of both the magnetic field and direction of currents. This technique can be readily extended to other device geometries.}",

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
